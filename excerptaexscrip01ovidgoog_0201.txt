THE METAMORPHOSES.

BOOK 1.

Pentros Ovinius Naso, a celebrated Roman poet, was born at
Sulmo, a town of the Peligni, about fort years before the Christian
era. His parents were of equestrian roni, and eduoated their son for
the bar, buthe soon forsook this and every other pursuit for the
cultivation of poetry‚ and et length became one of the most admired

ond eminent poete in· the court oflhugustus. His prosperity wes,
however, of short continuance. Havrng mcurred, by some unknown
offense, the diapleasure of the emperor, he was banished to Tomos,a

town near the uxine sea; where, after many ineffectus] attempts to
obtain the pardon of Augustus he ended his days, in the ei hth year
of hisubtmishment, aud the filiy·ninth year of his age. 'rie poetry
of Ovrd has long been celebrated forits variety, sweetness, and
elegance. But the frequent violatione of modesty, which disgrace
some parts of his writings, detract much from tlte meritos this gifted
poet. His Metamorphoses, though not the most finished ofhis oems,

Many of these traditions appear to have been originally founded on
historical facts ; but it is, in most instances, impossible to trace the
trutbs of history through the tales of superstition and the fictione> of

poet, in allusion to is design of writing of transformatione, begins
by making e trensfonnation of his words-Fert animas: ‘I design.

poet therefore with propriety invokes their aid in describing these
