was distin ‘rhed as much by his raahness and Impetuosity, asb his
invincihle ravery. Ulysses, the son of Laertes, and king of I tca,
was Iesa valiant in war than his rival; but he manifested greater
eloquence and wisdom in council, and rendered more essential assist-
ance to the Greeks by his advice, than Ajax hy his arms. In the
contentiori between these heroes, Ovid has accurately delineated their
characters. The speech os the son os Telamon evinces tho honest
ι bluntness of the soldier3 while in the rcply of Ulysses, we perceivc
the insInuating and artful address of the orator.

thus made hIm invulnerable in every part except the heel by which
she held him. This precaution was not, however, sufficient to divest
